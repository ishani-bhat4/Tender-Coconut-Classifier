## 📝 Abstract

A variety of industry sectors—such as Food & Nutraceuticals, Pharma, Irrigation, Transport, and Automobile—use coconut and its parts for varied products. These sectors require **automated classification** of coconuts into different categories for efficient and faster processing. Our research focuses on the **automated sorting of coconuts** into the following categories:

- **Non-Tender Coconut**
- **Tender Whole Coconut**
- **Tender Coconut Cut with Flesh**
- **Tender Coconut Cut without Flesh**

We trained and tested both a **Decision Tree** and a **DenseNet deep learning model** for this task. While the Decision Tree achieved an accuracy of **93%**, the DenseNet model attained **100% accuracy**, demonstrating the clear advantage of deep learning in visual classification tasks.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- 📊 **Decision Tree Classifier**
- 🤖 **DenseNet (Deep Convolutional Neural Network)**

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled images of different types of coconuts, categorized into the four classes mentioned above. Each image is preprocessed (resized and normalized) before being passed into the model.

> *Note: Due to publication and privacy constraints, the dataset may not be publicly available. You can use placeholder image folders if needed for demonstration.*
